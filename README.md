This repo is going to contain a menagerie of my projects as I am learning Python.
Resources I'm currently going through:
1. [Intro To Python](http://www.introtopython.org)
2. [Python Crash Course](https://www.nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse) book by No Starch Press 
3. [TK's Learning Python: From Zero to Hero] (https://medium.freecodecamp.org/learning-python-from-zero-to-hero-120ea540b567)

I'll update this as I go through more resources.
